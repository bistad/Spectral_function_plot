# Spectral Function Plot
## Overview

This repository contains scripts and instructions for performing Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations using Questaal, and for processing and visualizing the results using python libraries. This workflow is designed for researchers in our group to optimize, use, and contribute to.
## Prerequisites

    Linux operating system or a compatible environment that can run shell scripts and the Questaal suite.
    Python 3.x with the following packages installed:
        pandas for data manipulation.
        matplotlib for data visualization.
    Questaal installed and properly configured on your system.
    An understanding of DFT calculations and the specific requirements for your project.

## Installation and Setup

    Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone [github link](https://github.com/bistad/Spectral_function_plot).
    Ensure that Questaal is installed and correctly configured on your system. Refer to the official Questaal documentation for  installation instructions.
    Install the required Python packages by running pip install pandas matplotlib.

## Usage
Running DFT Calculations with Questaal

    Prepare your script.sh file with the appropriate Questaal commands for your DFT calculations.
    Run the following command in the terminal to submit your job to the system:

    sh

    sbatch script.sh

    The calculation will produce an output file named spf.fept, which will be used for further processing.

Data Processing

    Preprocess the spf.fept file to extract symmetry points and generate the output.csv file. This step might require a custom script based on your specific needs.
    Use the following Python snippet to import the output.csv file, preprocess the data, and calculate the average spectral function:

    python

    import pandas as pd

    # Load the CSV file
    df = pd.read_csv('output.csv')

    # Preprocess and calculate the average (A) between A_up and A_down
    df['A'] = df[['A_up', 'A_down']].mean(axis=1)

Visualization

    To visualize the spectral function, use the following Python code as a template. Adjust the plotting parameters as necessary to suit your data:

    python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Example plotting code
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.scatter(df['Distance'], df['Energy'], c=df['A'], cmap='viridis')
    plt.colorbar(label='Average Spectral Function')
    plt.xlabel('Distance (along symmetry points)')
    plt.ylabel('Energy')
    plt.title('Spectral Function Visualization')
    plt.show()

    This script will generate a plot of the spectral function, showing the relationship between distance (along symmetry points), energy, and the average spectral function through the broadening of the plot.
